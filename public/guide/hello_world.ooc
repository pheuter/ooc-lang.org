of what just happened would be nice. */

Finished parsing, now tinkering...


/* The next stage, libcaching, depends upon the parsing. Notice that there now exists a .libs directory in your current directory. It contains
translated C header files that are essential to the compile time of your program. In this case, <code>stdio.h</code> 
and <code>string.h</code> will be used (in addition to other boilerplate runtime libraries). Libcaching will happen
once per program per directory, meaning that if you <code>mv hello_world.ooc</code> elsewhere, compiling 
it with rock will create a .libs in that new directory. Also, if you import new libraries or implement new
ooc constructs, .libs will be updated accordingly. */
